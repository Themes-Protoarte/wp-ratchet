# wp-ratchet

## Description

Fully responsive and touch-driven WordPress theme built upon the [Ratchet 2.0](http://goratchet.com/) framework. This theme is meant to complement your desktop theme.

Not all features of a typical WordPress theme are yet implemented, this is work in progress! 

## Installation

### GitHub

1. Change directory to WordPress themes `cd wp-admin/themes`
2. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/idleberg/wp-ratchet.git`
3. Activate theme in the WordPress dashboard

### Manual download

1. Download the files using the GitHub .zip download option
2. Unzip the files to your WordPress themes directory

## Customization

By default, Ratchet ships with three themes: default, iOS and Android. You can use any Ratchet 2-compatible theme or create a custom one. Please refer to the [Ratchet documentation](http://goratchet.com/getting-started/) for details.

## Known bugs

There's currently a problem calling modals when browsing several pages with modals called. As a temporary fix, you can disable all `data-transition` attributes on the index page.
